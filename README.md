## Machine learning models for predicting the bulk modulus of materials

This repository is a collection of notebooks exploring various machine learning (ML) models for predicting the bulk modulus (K) of materials. The dataset comes from the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org), where the elastic tensors were calculated from first principles. The goal of the project is to develop an updated ML model because the previous model was trained on ~ 1500 data points, whereas now we have ~ 8500 data points. Additionally, the previous model was difficult to retrain so having a reproducible pipeline is important moving forward.
